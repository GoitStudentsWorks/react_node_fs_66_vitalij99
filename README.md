# So Yummy

Welcome to So Yummy! This web application provides a database of delicious
recipes, allowing users to search for recipes, create a user profile, add
recipes to the database, save favorite recipes, and generate a shopping list
based on recipe ingredients.

## Project Description

So Yummy is designed to help users discover and prepare various dishes easily.
It offers a vast collection of recipes across different cuisines, including
appetizers, main courses, desserts, and more. Users can search for recipes by
title or ingredients.

By creating a user profile, users can save their favorite recipes and access
them later. Additionally, users can contribute to the recipe database by adding
their own recipes.
